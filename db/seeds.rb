# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# # Examples:

#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# #
# State = State.create([{ name: 'PA' }, { user_id: '1'}])
# State = State.create([{ name: 'VA' }, { user_id: '1'}])
# State = State.create([{ name: 'NJ' }])
# State = State.create([{ name: 'FL' }])

# Shop = Shop.create([{ name: 'Starbucks' }])
# Shop = Shop.create([{ name: 'Dunkin' }])
# Shop = Shop.create([{ name: 'Terra Cafe' }])
# Shop = Shop.create([{ name: 'Simon's Cafe' }])
# #   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
